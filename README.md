# Architectureüìê

Our system operates on a client-server model, utilizing gRPC for efficient communication. To enhance compatibility, we've incorporated JSON transcoding, allowing seamless data exchange in JSON format between the client and server. This simplifies integration and ensures a smooth interaction. Explore the diagram below to visualize the key components and their interactions within the system:

AS you can see on the backend of our application follows Clean Architecture principles, which allows for a highly decoupled, testable, and maintainable codebase. The architecture of the system is divided into four layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation:

<div align="center">

</div>

## Domain
The Domain layer encompasses all entities, enums, exceptions, errors and logic that are specific to the business domain of the system.

## Application
The Application layer contains all application logic. It depends on the Domain layer, but is independent of any other layer or project. This layer contains command and query handlers, defines interfaces that other layers can implement. For instance, if the application requires access to a user repository, a new interface is added to the Application layer and an implementation is created within the Infrastructure layer.

## Infrastructure
The infrastructure layer refers to the layer that handles low-level tasks such as network communication, database access, and file system operations. It serves as a bridge between the application layer and the underlying infrastructure, providing a clean separation of concerns. This includes managing connections to databases, caching data and handling security. One of the main benefits of using an infrastructure layer is that it allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the API. By separating the application logic from the underlying infrastructure, changes to one layer can be made without affecting the other. This makes it easier to modify, test, and deploy the API as needed.

## Presentation
Finally, the Presentation layer is an ASP.NET Web API which gives us an opportunity to build SPA applications, Mobile apps or Desktop clients and so far. This layer is responsible for all user interface logic and depends on the Application layer.

# Other patterns and principlesüìö
As you may have noticed in the preceding diagram, there are several other patterns used in building this architecture. Let's explore these concepts to grasp how they contribute to building modular, testable, and maintainable software.

## Mediator
Mediator provides a simple and elegant way to implement communication between different components of a system without directly coupling them together. In this pattern, each component sends messages to a mediator, which then distributes those messages to other components that have registered to handle them. This approach allows for a decoupled and loosely coupled architecture, where components do not need to know about each other's existence, promoting scalability and maintainability. Overall, MediatR promotes the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and enhances the modularity and testability of the system.

## CQRS
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) design pattern separates the operations that modify state from those that read state in a system. This separation allows for different optimizations and scaling strategies for the two types of operations. In a CQRS architecture, commands represent actions that change the state of the system, while queries represent requests for information about the system's current state. By separating these concerns, a CQRS system can be optimized for both high write throughput and fast query performance. However, implementing a CQRS architecture can be complex and may require significant changes to existing systems.

### Unit of Work
The Unit of Work pattern ensures the proper management of transactions and maintains data consistency throughout an application. It helps orchestrate multiple operations within a single transaction, either committing all changes or rolling back if an error occurs. The Unit of Work pattern is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring atomicity in data operations.

### Generic Repository
The Generic Repository pattern provides a standardized interface for data access operations. It allows for generic implementations of common data access methods, promoting code reusability and consistency in data interactions. The Generic Repository pattern simplifies the data access layer by providing a uniform API for various entities within the application.

### Result
The Result pattern enhances error handling and response generation in an application. It provides a structured way to handle success and failure scenarios, allowing for better communication of outcomes between components. The Result pattern contributes to the overall robustness of the system by promoting clear and consistent handling of results.
These patterns collectively contribute to a well-architected system, promoting modularity, testability, and maintainability in software development.
